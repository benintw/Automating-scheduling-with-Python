## Description
The purpose of this streamlit app is to automate heavyly repetitive task to simple dragging and dropping files and clicking buttons.
However, this is a task-specific app and is not for other uses. 

Nevertheless, this app shortens what would usually take 5~6 hours of work to just less than 2 minutes.

## Why did i write this app?
A friend of my friend works as a schedule coordinator at this company. One of her monthly task is to collect the monthly schedules from 15 different dispatch teams and formant and finalize to one monthly scheduling report for the entire company to use. 
This involves going through 15 different excels and word documents, while each file has slightly different formatting, and typing down which team leaders, deputy officers, and chief officers are on duty on each day. 

This is again another project for automating...

## How to use it?

The input files are the schedules from different dispatch teams (either in Word or Excel).

Here are the steps to use this app:
  1. The user will enter the correct password to use the app.
  2. The user will upload the 15 schedules of excel/word format.
  3. The user should ensure all Word .doc files are in .docx format.
  *I have provided a gif explaining how to convert from .doc to .docx
  4. The app will then check for any missing values.
  5.
